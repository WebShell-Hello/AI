    "**totalLoss = PolicyLoss − 𝑐1 × ValueLoss + 𝑐2 × EntropyBonus**\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula represents how the algorithm calculates the error during training and adjusts the policy network accordingly. The total loss is updated periodically over each Rollout cycle, which represents the data collection period. The total loss consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy Loss**: This term measures how much the current policy (the agent’s decision-making strategy) differs from the expected or optimal policy. The lower the policy loss, the better the policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Value Loss**: This term represents how much the agent's predicted value (the expected future reward from a given state) differs from the actual observed reward. It is related to the accuracy of the value function used to evaluate actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entropy Regularisation Reward (Entropy Bonus)**: This term encourages exploration by rewarding randomness in the agent’s actions. The idea is that the agent should not always stick to the same actions but should try different things to explore new strategies. A higher entropy bonus helps the agent explore more, while a lower one focuses the agent on exploiting its learned strategy."
